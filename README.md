Hello, This is my custom made repository consisting infared remotes and other tools that are meant to be an all in one pack consisting of all the resources you need
to flip devices commonly found in stores like Walmart. 

Note: This is just a compilation of different tools that can commonly be used in these type of stores and not all of these are gauranteed to work with your store, It depends
on what devices the store your at uses, these are common signals that can affect most stores.

Note: The folders in this directory should be dragged into your ALREADY EXISTING infared, subghz etc.. folders, this is why there is a "-WMP" at the end: to show the folders
are from the Walmart Project.

DISCLAIMER: I do NOT condone hacking or altering devices that are not intended to by the rightful owner. This repository is for educational and pentesting purposes only.
Please only use this tool after getting permision from the owner of devices you may be altering.

If you have any requests or questions on this repository please DM me on twitter @atbasjcs.
